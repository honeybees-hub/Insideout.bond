        </h1>
        <p>
            ​Effective Date: 4 December 2025
            <br>

            ​This Privacy Policy explains what information (if any) is collected when you use Inbondz.com, and how we
            handle it given that our website is entirely static and runs without a backend server.
            <br>
            ​1. Data We DO NOT Collect or Store
            <br>
            ​As a static, client-side website, Inbondz does not collect, store, or log any personal information or
            sensitive data:
            <br>
            ​No Personal Identifiers: We do not collect names, email addresses, or any unique identifier as we have no
            account system.
            <br>
            ​No Server-Side Content Storage: The data you type into our utility tools (e.g., text for formatting) is
            processed by code running only in your web browser. This content is never sent to or saved on our hosting
            system.
            <br>
            ​No Server Logs: Since there is no application server, we do not generate usage logs related to the
            processing of your data in the tools.
            <br>
            ​2. Data Collected by Third-Party Services
            <br>
            ​Although Inbondz itself does not collect data, we embed third-party services for essential functions
            (advertising and traffic analysis). These external services operate independently of us.
            <br>
            ​A. Advertising Networks (Third-Party Cookies)
            ​Data Collected: Third-party advertising partners use cookies and similar technologies to collect
            non-personal information (like your IP address, browser type, and websites visited) to serve relevant
            advertisements.
            <br>
            ​Control: This data collection is solely managed by the advertising networks. You can usually manage your ad
            preferences or opt out of personalized advertising through their settings.
            <br>
            ​B. Analytics
            ​We may use basic analytics (e.g., Google Analytics) to measure anonymous traffic statistics (which pages
            are visited).
            <br>
            ​Data Collected: This service collects anonymized data about your session, such as device type, browser, and
            pages viewed. This data is aggregated and cannot be used to personally identify you.
            <br>
            ​3. External Links and Data Responsibility
            <br>
            ​Leaving Inbondz: When you follow a link from our search results or advertising to an external website, this
            Privacy Policy no longer applies.
            <br>
            ​Your Responsibility: We are not responsible for the data practices, tracking methods, or cookie policies of
            any external website. We urge you to review the privacy policy of any site you visit after leaving Inbondz.
            <br>
            ​4. Updates to this Policy
            <br>
            ​We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy. We will post the updated policy on this page, and the
            "Effective Date" will be revised.
