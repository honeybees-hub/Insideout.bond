            <br>
            ​By accessing or using the services provided by Inbondz.com (the "Website"), you agree to comply with and be

            <br>
            ​1. Nature of the Service (Client-Side Utilities)
            <br>
            ​Inbondz provides a collection of simple digital utilities (such as text formatters, generators, etc.) and a
            search interface.
            <br>
            ​No Server Processing: All utility tools function entirely on your device and within your web browser. Our
            Website does not have a backend server to receive, process, or store the text or data you input into the
            tools.<br>
            ​No Accounts & No Storage: We do not provide user accounts, nor do we store any of your usage history or
            content on our host system.
            <br>
            ​Disclaimer: We provide these tools without any warranties regarding their accuracy, reliability, or future
            availability. You accept that you use all tools entirely at your own risk.
            <br>
            ​2. User Responsibilities

            ​You agree to use Inbondz only for lawful and ethical purposes. You must not:
            <br>
            ​Use the tools to create or process content that is illegal, abusive, or infringes on third-party
            intellectual property rights.
            <br>
            ​Attempt to access or interfere with the publicly hosted code of the Website.
            <br>
            ​Use automated scripts or bots to overload the public URL hosting service.
            <br>
            ​3. Limitation of Liability
            <br>
            ​Inbondz, its operators, or affiliates are not responsible for any issues or damages, including loss of
            data, errors in tool output, or service interruption, resulting from your use of the Website.
            <br>
            ​4. Third-Party Content and External Links
            <br>
            ​Advertising: The Website displays advertisements from third-party networks. We do not endorse these
            advertised services and are not responsible for their content or reliability.
            <br>
            ​External Links: The Website search and content may link to external, third-party sites. We have no control
            over, and bear no responsibility for, the content, cookies, or policies of those external sites. Your
            interaction with them is governed solely by their terms.
            <br>
            ​5. Updates to these Terms
